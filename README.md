# Enercom-project

This project, in collaboration with Enercom Energia, was related to the study and the proposal of a new business model, based on energy exchange.  The proposed idea was based on the use of a blockchian network, with the aim of matching prosumers, generating energy through panels, and users, using part of the energy by paying a fee. This project allowed me to improve my communication skills and to better discover group dynamics by working with many colleagues from several countries, improving my leadership attitude.
